        <h2>Rules</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>When shooting, always straddle the shooting line. Never pass the line or shoot from behind it while the range is hot</li>
          <li>Never load arrows, except while shooting</li>
          <li>Wear closed toed shoes if possible!</li>
          <li>Don't shoot cross range. This means shoot directly in-front of the target you are aiming for</li>
          <li>When you go to get your arrows, leave you bow at least 5 feet behind the shooting line</li>
          <li>Never dry fire a bow, meaning shoot it without an arrow. This can break them, especially our compounds!</li>
          <li>Have fun!</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Range Calls</h2>
        <p><b>1st Whistle</b> - Head to the shooting line, you may knock an arrow but do NOT draw the bow</p>
        <p><b>2nd Whistle</b> - You may shoot</p>
        <p><b>3 Whistles</b> - Range is clear, you may pull your arrows</p>
        <p><b>4 or more Whistles</b> - EMERGENCY stop shooting IMMEDIATELY</p>
