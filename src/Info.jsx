        <ol>
          <li>When shooting, always straddle the shooting line. Never pass the shooting line unless 3 whistles have been blown and the range is clear to pull arrows.</li>
          <li>When you go to get your arrows, leave your bow behind the shooting line</li>
          <li>Never dry fire a bow (meaning shoot without an arrow).</li>
          <li>Pull arrows from the target by their the base, this is to not bend them.</li>
